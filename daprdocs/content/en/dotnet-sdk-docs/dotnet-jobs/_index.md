description: Get up and running with Dapr Jobs and the Dapr .NET SDK
---

With the Dapr Job package, you can interact with the Dapr Job APIs from a .NET application to trigger future operations
to run according to a predefined schedule with an optional payload.

To get started, walk through the [Dapr Jobs]({{< ref dotnet-jobs-howto.md >}}) how-to guide and refer to
[best practices documentation]({{< ref dotnet-jobsclient-usage.md >}}) for additional guidance.
