# Aspire with Dapr Service Invocation Demo

This directory contains demonstration projects showcasing how to use .NET Aspire with Dapr to perform service invocation between frontend and backend applications using different approaches.

## Overview

The ServiceInvocationDemo demonstrates various patterns for service-to-service communication in a distributed application architecture using:

- **.NET Aspire** - For application orchestration, service discovery, and observability
- **Dapr** - For distributed application runtime capabilities including service invocation
- **ASP.NET Core** - For both frontend and backend services

## Project Structure

The demo includes:
- **Frontend Application** - Web application that invokes backend services
- **Backend Application** - API services that handle business logic
- **AppHost** - Aspire orchestration project that coordinates all services
- Multiple service invocation approaches and patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Docker Desktop (for Dapr components)
- Dapr CLI installed and initialized

### Running the Demo

1. Navigate to the ServiceInvocationDemo.AppHost project directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/Hosting/Aspire/ServiceInvocationDemo/ServiceInvocationDemo.AppHost
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. The console will display the Aspire dashboard URL. Open the provided link in your browser.

4. In the Aspire dashboard, click on the `http://localhost:5054/` link to access the demo application.

5. The main page will present various service invocation demonstration scenarios that you can explore.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- Integration between .NET Aspire orchestration and Dapr runtime
- Service-to-service communication patterns
- Development-time productivity with Aspire dashboard
- Production-ready distributed application patterns

## No Additional Setup Required

The demo is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal setup. Simply run `dotnet run` from the AppHost project, and all necessary services will be orchestrated automatically through Aspire's application model.

## Architecture Benefits

This demonstration highlights the benefits of combining Aspire and Dapr:

- **Simplified Local Development** - Aspire handles service orchestration and provides rich debugging experience
- **Production Readiness** - Dapr provides rich distributed application patterns
- **Flexibility** - Multiple approaches to solve service invocation challenges

Explore the different demo scenarios to understand how these technologies work together to build resilient and maintainable distributed applications.
