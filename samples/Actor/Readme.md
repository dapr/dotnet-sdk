# Dapr Actor Sample

The Actor sample shows how to create an Actor (`DemoActor`) and invoke its methods on the client application.

## Prerequistes

* [.Net Core SDK 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Dapr CLI](https://github.com/dapr/cli)
* [Dapr DotNet SDK](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk)

## Projects in sample

You can open the solution file `samples.sln` in the `samples` directory to load the samples and product code.

* **The interface project (`\IDemoActor`).** This project contains the interface definition for the actor. The interface defines the actor contract that is shared by the actor implementation and the clients calling the actor. Because client projects may depend on it, it typically makes sense to define it in an assembly that is separate from the actor implementation.

* **The actor service project (`\DemoActor`).** This project implements ASP.Net Core web service that is going to host the actor. It contains the implementation of the actor. An actor implementation is a class that derives from the base type `Actor` and implements the interfaces defined in the corresponding interfaces project. An actor class must also implement a constructor that accepts an `ActorService` instance and an `ActorId` and passes them to the base `Actor` class.

* **The actor client project (`\ActorClient`)** This project contains the implementation of the actor client which calls `DemoActor`'s methods defined in `IDemoActor`'s Interfaces.

## Running the Sample

To run the actor service locally run this command in `DemoActor` directory:

```sh
 dapr run --port 3500 --app-id demo_actor --app-port 5000 dotnet run
```

The `DemoActor` service will listen on port `5000` for HTTP.

### Making Client calls

The `ActorClient` project shows how to make client calls for actor using Remoting which provides a strongly typed invocation experience.
Run the client project from `ActorClient` directory as:

```sh
 dotnet run
 ```

### Invoke Actor method without Remoting over Http

You can invoke Actor methods without remoting (directly over http), if the Actor method accepts at-most one argument.
Actor runtime will deserialize the incoming request body from client and use it as method argument to invoke the actor method.
When making non-remoting calls Actor method arguments and return types are serialized, deserialized as JSON.

**Save Data**
Following curl call will save data for actor id "abc"
(below calls on MacOs, Linux & Windows are exactly the same except for escaping quotes on Windows for curl)

On Linux, MacOS:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3500/v1.0/actors/DemoActor/abc/method/SaveData -d '{ "PropertyA": "ValueA", "PropertyB": "ValueB" }'
```

 On Windows:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3500/v1.0/actors/DemoActor/abc/method/SaveData -d "{ \"PropertyA\": \"ValueA\", \"PropertyB\": \"ValueB\" }"

```

**Get Data**
Following curl call will get data for actor id "abc"
(below calls on MacOs, Linux & Windows are exactly the same except for escaping quotes on Windows for curl)

On Linux, MacOS:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3500/v1.0/actors/DemoActor/abc/method/GetData
```

On Windows:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3500/v1.0/actors/DemoActor/abc/method/GetData
```
